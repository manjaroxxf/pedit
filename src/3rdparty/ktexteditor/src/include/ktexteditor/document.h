 * \class Document document.h <KTextEditor/Document>
 *
 * \brief A KParts derived class representing a text document.
 *
 * Topics:
 *  - \ref doc_intro
 *  - \ref doc_manipulation
 *  - \ref doc_views
 *  - \ref doc_readwrite
 *  - \ref doc_notifications
 *  - \ref doc_recovery
 *  - \ref doc_extensions
 *
 * \section doc_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Document class represents a pure text document providing methods to
 * modify the content and create views. A document can have any number
 * of views, each view representing the same content, i.e. all views are
 * synchronized. Support for text selection is handled by a View and text
 * format attributes by the Attribute class.
 *
 * To load a document call KParts::ReadOnlyPart::openUrl().
 * To reload a document from a file call documentReload(), to save the
 * document call documentSave() or documentSaveAs(). Whenever the modified
 * state of the document changes the signal modifiedChanged() is emitted.
 * Check the modified state with KParts::ReadWritePart::isModified().
 * Further signals are documentUrlChanged(). The encoding can be specified
 * with setEncoding(), however this will only take effect on file reload and
 * file save.
 *
 * \section doc_manipulation Text Manipulation
 *
 * Get the whole content with text() and set new content with setText().
 * Call insertText() or insertLine() to insert new text or removeText()
 * and removeLine() to remove content. Whenever the document's content
 * changed the signal textChanged() is emitted. Additional signals are
 * textInserted() and textRemoved(). Note, that the first line in the
 * document is line 0.
 *
 * A Document provides full undo/redo history.
 * Text manipulation actions can be grouped together to one undo/redo action by
 * using an the class EditingTransaction. You can stack multiple EditingTransaction%s.
 * Internally, the Document has a reference counter. If this reference counter
 * is increased the first time (by creating an instance of EditingTransaction),
 * the signal editingStarted() is emitted. Only when the internal reference counter
 * reaches zero again, the signal editingFinished() and optionally the signal
 * textChanged() are emitted. Whether an editing transaction is currently active
 * can be checked by calling isEditingTransactionRunning().
 *
 * @note The signal editingFinished() is always emitted when the last instance
 *       of EditingTransaction is destroyed. Contrary, the signal textChanged()
 *       is emitted only if text changed. Hence, textChanged() is more accurate
 *       with respect to changes in the Document.
 *
 * Every text editing transaction is also available through the signals
 * lineWrapped(), lineUnwrapped(), textInserted() and textRemoved().
 * However, these signals should be used with care. Please be aware of the
 * following warning:
 *
 * @warning Never change the Document's contents when edit actions are active,
 *          i.e. in between of (foreign) editing transactions. In case you
 *          violate this, the currently active edit action may perform edits
 *          that lead to undefined behavior.
 *
 * \section doc_views Document Views
 *
 * A View displays the document's content. As already mentioned, a document
 * can have any number of views, all synchronized. Get a list of all views
 * with views(). Create a new view with createView(). Every time a new view
 * is created the signal viewCreated() is emitted.
 *
 * \section doc_readwrite Read-Only Mode
 *
 * A Document may be in read-only mode, for instance due to missing file
 * permissions. The read-only mode can be checked with isReadWrite(). Further,
 * the signal readWriteChanged() is emitted whenever the state changes either
 * to read-only mode or to read/write mode. The read-only mode can be controlled
 * with setReadWrite().
 *
 * \section doc_notifications Notifications in Documents and Views
 *
 * A Document has the ability to show a Message to the user in a View.
 * The Message then is shown either the specified View if Message::setView()
 * was called, or in all View%s of the Document.
 *
 * To post a message just create a new Message and send it with postMessage().
 * Further information is available in the API documentation of Message.
 *
 * @see Message
 *
 * \section doc_recovery Crash Recovery for Documents
 *
 * When the system or the application using the editor component crashed
 * with unsaved changes in the Document, the View notifies the user about
 * the lost data and asks, whether the data should be recovered.
 *
 * This Document gives you control over the data recovery process. Use
 * isDataRecoveryAvailable() to check for lost data. If you do not want the
 * editor component to handle the data recovery process automatically, you can
 * either trigger the data recovery by calling recoverData() or discard it
 * through discardDataRecovery().
 *
 * \section doc_extensions Document Extension Interfaces
 *
 * A simple document represents text and provides text manipulation methods.
 * However, a real text editor should support advanced concepts like session
 * support, textsearch support, bookmark/general mark support etc. That is why
 * the KTextEditor library provides several additional interfaces to extend
 * a document's capabilities via multiple inheritance.
 *
 * More information about interfaces for the document can be found in
 * \ref kte_group_doc_extensions.
 *
 * \see KParts::ReadWritePart, KTextEditor::Editor, KTextEditor::View,
 *      KTextEditor::MarkInterface, KTextEditor::ModificationInterface,
 *      KTextEditor::MovingInterface
