 * \brief Text hint interface showing tool tips under the mouse for the View.
 *
 * \ingroup kte_group_view_extensions
 *
 * \section texthint_introduction Introduction
 *
 * The text hint interface provides a way to show tool tips for text located
 * under the mouse. Possible applications include showing a value of a variable
 * when debugging an application, or showing a complete path of an include
 * directive.
 *
 * \image html texthint.png "Text hint showing the contents of a variable"
 *
 * To register as text hint provider, call registerTextHintProvider() with an
 * instance that inherits TextHintProvider. Finally, make sure you remove your
 * text hint provider by calling unregisterTextHintProvider().
 *
 * Text hints are shown after the user hovers with the mouse for a delay of
 * textHintDelay() milliseconds over the same word. To change the delay, call
 * setTextHintDelay().
 *
 * \section texthint_access Accessing the TextHintInterface
 *
 * The TextHintInterface is an extension interface for a
 * View, i.e. the View inherits the interface. Use qobject_cast to access the
 * interface:
 * \code
 * // view is of type KTextEditor::View*
 * auto iface = qobject_cast<KTextEditor::TextHintInterface*>(view);
 *
 * if (iface) {
 *     // the implementation supports the interface
 *     // myProvider inherits KTextEditor::TextHintProvider
 *     iface->registerTextHintProvider(myProvider);
 * } else {
 *     // the implementation does not support the interface
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \see TextHintProvider
 * \since 4.11

 * it with TextHintInterface::registerTextHintProvider(). When not needed
 * anymore, make sure to remove your provider by calling
 * TextHintInterface::unregisterTextHintProvider(), otherwise the View will
 * contain a dangling pointer to your potentially deleted provider.

 * Detailed information about how to use the TextHintInterface can be found
 * in the documentation about the TextHintInterface.
