 *
 * AbstractAnnotationItemDelegate is a base class that can be reimplemented
 * to customize the rendering of annotation information for each line in a document.
 * It provides also the hooks to define handling of help events like tooltip or of
 * the request for a context menu.
 *
 * \section annodelegate_impl Implementing an AbstractAnnotationItemDelegate
 *
 * The public interface of this class is loosely based on the QAbstractItemDelegate
 * interfaces. It has five methods to implement.
 *
 * \since 5.53
 * \see KTextEditor::AnnotationModel, KTextEditor::AnnotationViewInterfaceV2
