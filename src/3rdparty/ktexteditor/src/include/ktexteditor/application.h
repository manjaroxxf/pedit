 * \class Application application.h <KTextEditor/Application>
 *
 * This class allows the application that embeds the KTextEditor component to
 * allow it access to application wide information and interactions.
 *
 * For example the component can get the current active main window of the application.
 *
 * The application must pass a pointer to the Application object to the setApplication method of the
 * global editor instance and ensure that this object stays valid for the complete lifetime of the editor.
 *
 * It must not reimplement this class but construct an instance and pass a pointer to a QObject that
 * has the required slots to receive the requests.
 *
 * KTextEditor::Editor::instance()->application() will always return a non-nullptr object
 * to avoid the need for nullptr checks before calling the API.
 *
 * The same holds for activeMainWindow(), even if no main window is around, you will get a non-nullptr
 * interface object that allows to call the functions of the MainWindow without needs for a nullptr
 * check around it in the client code.
