/**
 * Helper class that mimics some of the behaviour of KDevelop's code completion, in particular
 * whether it performs "bracket merging" on completed function calls e.g. if we complete a call
 * to "functionCall(int a)" at the end of the -> here:
 *
 *  object->(
 *
 * we end up with
 *
 *  object->functionCall(
 *
 * and the cursor placed after the closing bracket: the opening bracket is merged with the existing
 * bracket.
 *
 * However, if we do the same with
 *
 *  object->
 *
 * we end up with
 *
 *  object->functionCall()
 *
 * again with the cursor placed after the opening bracket.  This time, the brackets were not merged.
 *
 * This helper class is used to test how Macros and replaying of last changes works with complex
 * code completion.
